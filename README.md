# Explanation:
- Top Section ('h4'):
The 'h4' in the CSS defines a gradient background, white text color, centered alignment, and padding. This creates an eye-catching header with a promotional message.
- Navigation Bar ('nav class="navbar"'):
The navbar class styles the navigation bar at the top of the page. It sets a black background, sticky position, white text color, and padding for spacing.
Inside this navigation bar, the 'h5' elements represent navigation links for different categories, and they have a margin for spacing.
The input element and search icon are styled to form a search bar.
- Top Page Title ('section class="sale"'):
The "sale"-title class styles the top section of the page. It sets a background image, text color, and padding for spacing.
The header inside this section has a semi-transparent background for better readability of the title and description text.
- Mid Trending Section ('section class=""category-1""'):
The "category-1" class gives padding and a light background color to the trending section.
The "sub" class styles the container for the trending items. It gives a slightly darker background and margin for spacing.
Inside this container, each "tr" class styles an individual item box with a set height, width, background color, and white text. This creates a grid-like display of images and captions.
- "Category-2" Section ('section class="Category-2"'):
The"Category-2" class creates a gradient background for the bottom section, which is likely intended to contrast with the top section.
- Container ('div class="container"'):
The container class gives the entire section a width of 100% and makes it cover the full viewport height. It is used to create a visually impactful section.
-  Shoe ('div class="shoe"'):
The "shoe" class styles the container for shoe information and image. It sets a width, height, padding, and shadow.
Inside this container, the "des" class styles the text content with a maximum width, white text color, and spacing.
The shoe image is styled using the "shoe-1" class. It's positioned absolutely, has a circular border radius, and has a subtle hover effect to enlarge it.
